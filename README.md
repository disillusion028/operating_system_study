This assignment will make you more familiar with the Unix system call interface and the shell by implementing several features in a small shell, which we will refer to as the 6.828 shell. You can do this assignment on any operating system that supports the Unix API (a Linux Athena machine, your laptop with Linux or MacOS, etc.).
